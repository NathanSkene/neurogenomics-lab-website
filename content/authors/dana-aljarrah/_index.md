I completed my MSc in Translational Neuroscience with a computational focus at Imperial College London. I conducted my MSc project at the Skene Lab where I developed a method for single-cell epigenomic profiling for use with post-mortem human brains. I am now optimising this method with the goal of identifying the specific cell subtypes involved in Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, reading, volunteering, and climbing!
