During my BSc in Biochemistry at King's College London, I initially focused on proteins and protein modelling. However, I gradually shifted towards computational analysis of DNA, finishing with a final year project supervised by Dr Aleksej Zelezniak focusing on using machine learning to predict mRNA expression in Ascomycota sequences.

I am now pursuing a master's degree in Bioinformatics at Imperial where I remain deeply interested in computational DNA analysis. More recently, I have just completed a project working with Dr Ximena Montano and Dr Derek Huntley to analyse scRNAseq and Cosmx spatial data in cancer. I've since joined the Skene lab with the aim of further learning about computational techniques for genetic data analysis.
