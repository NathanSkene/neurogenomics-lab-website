I am a rising junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill majoring in neuroscience and minoring in data science. I am at the lab as part of my third summer experience as a [Morehead-Cain Scholar](https://www.moreheadcain.org/) at UNC Chapel Hill. I am working with Mr. Thomas Roberts in the Skene Lab to develop tutorials and documentation for analysing TIP-seq data, focusing on the profiling of epigenomic data. These tutorials will be accessible to researchers without a computational background and without any knowledge of TIP-seq.
