After completing my undergraduate studies in Biochemistry at UCL, I am eager to focus my academic pursuits on infection and immunology. During my time at university, I joined the UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing, where I investigated the pharmacological effects on the rate of ageing and the timing of the onset of age-related diseases. These experiences ignited my curiosity about how genomics influence the immune system and contribute to disease pathology.
 
Subsequently, I embarked on my masterâ€™s degree in Immunology and Inflammation at Imperial College London, where I was thrilled to join a lab. Currently, I am engaged in research focused on the development of automated Targeted Insertion of Promoters Sequencing (TIP-seq).
