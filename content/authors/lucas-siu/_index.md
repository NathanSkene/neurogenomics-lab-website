I studied mathematics at Imperial College London where I also obtained my integrated masters. I became interested in the development of machine learning techniques from a statistical perspective during a research project at LSE, where I looked at implementing latent variable models and understanding complexities that arise when estimating parameters whose true value lies at the boundary of a parameter space. 

My masterâ€™s thesis focused on using Gaussian Process approximations to estimate smooth contact intensities, with an overall aim to better understand HIV transmission patterns in Uganda. Moving forward, I am excited to apply these models in the field and improve prediction-making on genetic variant data. In my spare time, I enjoy watching and playing sport and reading.
