My name is Giovanni Veronelli and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, specialising in Information Bioengineering. 
Before my master, I obtained a bachelor degree in Biomedical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

My academic specialisation includes signal and image analysis, data analysis, machine learning and deep learning.

I have now joined the Skene group at UKDRI to work on my Master's thesis project. The project will focus on exploring the use of genetically diverse data for
ML model training, with the aim of improving performance in predicting the magnitude of epigenetic signals and motif identification.
