Before joining the lab, I achieved my undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge, with a focus on pathology before pursuing a master's in Applied Genomics from Imperial. This blend of computational and experimental experience has brought my journey to the UK DRI neurogenomics lab where I now work on optimising novel spatial transcriptomic technique coppaFISH in human brain tissue with the aim to understand selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases.

Currently engaged in doctoral studies at King's College London.
