# Postdoctoral Researchers

We are always eager to discuss applications for postdoctoral fellowships and are particularly interested in candidates with backgrounds in **Epigenetics**, **Computational Biology**, or **Machine Learning**. Below is a curated list of relevant opportunities. This list is not exhaustive, so we highly encourage those who have identified other suitable funding sources to get in touch with us!

- <a href="https://www.embo.org/">EMBO</a> - Supports excellent postdoctoral researchers for a period of up to two years. 
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-office/funder-information/research-fellowships/icrf/">Imperial College Research Fellowships (ICRF)</a> - Designed for outstanding early career researchers looking for an opportunity to focus on research and establish scientific independence.
- <a href="https://ibro.org/open-calls/">International Brain Research Organization</a> - A broad range of opportunities to support neuroscience research.
- <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/">Marie Curie actions</a> - Designed to support researchersâ€™ careers and foster excellence.

For those specifically interested in **Machine Learning**, the lab welcomes applications for <a href="https://www.hfsp.org/">HFSP Cross-disciplinary fellowships</a>. This programme supports proposals for frontier, potentially transformative research in the life sciences, and is targeted at researchers who hold a doctoral degree from a non-biological discipline. Applications for high-risk projects are particularly encouraged. 

We are also keen to hear from people interested in the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/research/opportunities/chapman-schmidt-ai-in-science-fellowships/">Chapman-Schmidt AI in Science Fellowships</a>. These fellowships have the aim of identifying excellent researchers and accelerating them in using AI to advance and disrupt Science or Engineering.

# PhD students

## Sources for PhD funding

There are a number of sources for PhD scholarships at Imperial:

- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/presidents-phd-scholarships/">Presidents scholarship</a>. 50 highly competitive PhD studentships per year.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/multisci-mrc-dtp/">Medical Research Council MultiSci MRC DTC studentships</a>. Around 10 fully funded positions per year.
- <a href="https://ai4health.io/">UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Healthcare</a>. This program involves bringing AI researchers together with clinical researchers; we expect to be submitting project proposals with interested students.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/csc/">The China Scholarship Council (CSC) Scheme</a>. PhD funding exclusively for students from China.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/ims/">The Imperial Marshall Scholarship Scheme</a>. PhD/MSc funding exclusively for students from USA.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/international-relations/cnrs-imperial-phd-joint-programme/">Imperial College London-CNRS PhD Joint Programme</a>. This recently established programme is focused on 'Mathematics, data and their applications across all areas of science'. Students will spend half their time at Imperial and half at CNRS.

If you are interested in applying for these programmes then contact Nathan to discuss your application.

# Masters students

Get in touch about potential projects. We frequently take students from the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/experimental-neuroscience/">MRes Experimental Neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/translational-neuroscience/">MSc Translational Neuroscience</a> programmes at Imperial College. We're also happy to speak to students from other programmes at Imperial.

Whether you are at Imperial or not, if you have strong quantitative / computing skills then we will consider supervising remote projects: contact us if you wish to discuss potential projects.
